## Intro

Welcome to the Closinglock frontend technical challenge!

Thank you for taking the time to interview with our team and work on this challenge. We're excited to see what you can do.

To get started, clone this repo and push an update to the this README.md to acknowledge that you're set up and ready for the challenge. This will help us ensure that we're all on the same page and that you have a solid starting point.

The technical challenge will be pushed to this repo when the interview process begins. We ask that you push your work at the end of the allotted time, but you're welcome to push portions of your work as you solve some of the tasks.

This is an open-book challenge, so feel free to use any tools or IDE you feel comfortable with.

We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

Best of luck,

The Closinglock Frontend Team
